A full-height glazed slot splits the main mass, channeling natural light deep into the plan while visually stitching the front and rear gardens together. Angled bay windows project from the upper level to frame specific landscape views and add sculptural presence to the street elevation. A sharply angled roof overhang shelters the entrance and casts shifting shadow patterns throughout the day.",
